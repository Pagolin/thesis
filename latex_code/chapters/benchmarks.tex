\section{Test Setup}
\section{The YCSB}

The "Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark" YCSB \cite{YSBC} comprises a framework to compare the performance of different database and key-value-store implementations. The two key components are an adaptable client that generates workloads for a connected database and a set of core workload scenarios resembling common use cases of data base deployments. The open source implementation of YCSB\footnote{\url{https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki}} already includes the benchmarking setups for many commonly used systems as DynamoDB, Redis, Cassandra, MongoDB and many more. Adding new test targets is possible via an abstraction layer for the concrete database API. This abstraction layer called \code{database interface layer} has to provide concrete implementations for common database commands i.e. read, insert, update, delete and scan for the new data base. Also the YSBC client needs to be set up to connect to the concrete data base. \\

    \item  $\rightarrow$ probably needs some adaptation or/and I need to change the current interface of the application so that it resembles the basic database interface
    \item in particular I'll need to add 'tables' to the key-value-store API
