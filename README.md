# thesis

This repo contains my Diploma thesis in coputer science. The topic of the thesis is "Compiling Unikernels to Microkernels". 
The main object questions of this thesis where:
1. Which code transformations are neccessary to refactor an application written for shared-memory environments, 
   to make it amenable to compilation to a data flow graph with local states?
2. Can we teach an existing compiler to do those transformmations?
