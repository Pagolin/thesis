# Diploma thesis - Compiling unikernels to microkernels

This repo contains my diploma thesis in computer science.

The main questions of this thesis were:

1. What code transformations are necessary to refactor an application written for shared memory environments, 
   to make it suitable for compilation into a dataflow graph with local states?

2. Can we teach an existing compiler to perform these transformations?
